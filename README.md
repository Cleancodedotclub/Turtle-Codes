Python Turtle Graphics is a Python project that demonstrates the power of Python's built-in turtle module. The project contains a collection of Python programs that use the turtle graphics to draw various shapes and designs. The turtle module provides a set of functions that allow you to create a turtle object, move it around the screen, and draw lines and shapes with it. The project includes examples of drawing shapes such as squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles, as well as more complex designs such as spirals, fractals, and even a snake game. The code is designed to be easy to read and understand, making it a great project for beginners who are looking to get started with Python programming.
